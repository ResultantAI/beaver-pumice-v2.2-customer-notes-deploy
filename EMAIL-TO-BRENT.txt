Subject: Fixed: Ticket Values Changing on Print

Hi Brent,

Good news – I've identified and fixed the intermittent issue where ticket values were changing when your foreman went to print them. The fix is now live in production.

WHAT WAS HAPPENING:
The problem was a timing issue. When a ticket was created, the system would calculate values (tons, yards, pricing) and send them to our database. The database has its own formulas that recalculate these same values for accuracy. When someone printed the ticket immediately after creating it, sometimes the database formulas hadn't finished calculating yet, so the print would show incomplete or wrong values.

Think of it like this: The foreman enters the data and hits "Create," which is like submitting paperwork. The back office (Airtable) then verifies and recalculates everything. If the foreman printed before the back office finished their calculations, they'd get a blank or incomplete form.

WHAT I FIXED:
The system now waits about 1 second after creating a ticket to let the database finish all its calculations, then it double-checks that everything is correct before showing the "Print" button. This ensures the print always has the accurate, verified values from the database.

WHAT YOU'LL NOTICE:
- Ticket creation will take about 1 second longer (you won't really notice it)
- Prints will now ALWAYS show the correct values – no more discrepancies
- No changes to the workflow – operators don't need to do anything differently
- Works on both iPads in the field and desktop computers

NEXT STEPS:
Can you have your foreman test this over the next day or two? Specifically:
1. Create a few tickets as normal
2. Print them immediately after creation
3. Verify the printed values match what they entered (especially tons, yards, and pricing)
4. Let me know if they see ANY discrepancies

I'll monitor the system for the next 48 hours to make sure everything is working smoothly. If you notice any issues at all, please reach out immediately and I can adjust.

This should completely eliminate the intermittent value-changing issue. Please confirm once you've tested it out.

Thanks for reporting this – these kinds of reliability issues are top priority.

Best,
Chris
