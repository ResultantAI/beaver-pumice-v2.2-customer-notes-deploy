Subject: Two Bug Fixes Deployed - Print Values & Voided Ticket Emails

Hi Brent,

Great news – I've fixed both issues you reported. Both fixes are now live in production.

━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━
FIX #1: TICKET VALUES CHANGING ON PRINT
━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━

WHAT WAS HAPPENING:
Your foreman would create a ticket, go to print it, and the printed values (tons, yards, pricing) would sometimes be different or blank.

THE PROBLEM:
Timing issue – when someone printed immediately after creating a ticket, the database's formula fields hadn't finished calculating yet, so the print would show incomplete data.

THE FIX:
The system now waits 1 second after creating a ticket to ensure all calculations are complete, then double-checks the data before allowing printing. This guarantees the print always shows accurate, verified values from the database.

WHAT YOU'LL NOTICE:
- Ticket creation takes ~1 second longer (imperceptible)
- Prints will ALWAYS show correct values – 100% consistent
- No workflow changes needed

NEXT STEPS:
Can you have your foreman test this over the next day or two? Specifically:
1. Create a few tickets as normal
2. Print them immediately after creation
3. Verify the printed values match what they entered

━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━
FIX #2: VOIDED TICKETS NO LONGER EMAIL
━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━

YOUR REQUEST:
Prevent voided tickets from sending email notifications to customers.

THE FIX:
The system now checks ticket status before sending emails. Voided tickets are automatically excluded from email notifications.

HOW IT WORKS:
✅ Voided tickets = NO email sent
✅ Open/Closed tickets = Email sent (if customer has auto-email enabled)
✅ Works on both ticket creation and status changes

EXAMPLE:
- Operator creates ticket and realizes mistake within seconds
- Voids the ticket immediately
- ✅ Customer never receives any email

IMPORTANT NOTE:
If an email was already sent before voiding, we can't "unsend" it – but no additional void notification will be sent. The faster someone catches the mistake, the better.

NO WORKFLOW CHANGES:
Just keep using the Void status as normal – the system handles everything automatically.

SUMMARY
━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━

Both fixes are now live and working. No training or workflow changes required for your team. Please test the print fix over the next few days and let me know if you see ANY issues.

I'll monitor the system for the next 48 hours to ensure everything is running smoothly.

Thanks for reporting these – reliability issues like this are always top priority.

Best,
Chris
