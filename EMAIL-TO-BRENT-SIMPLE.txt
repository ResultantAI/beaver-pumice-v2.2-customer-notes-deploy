Subject: Fixed - Grant's 0.00 CY Email Issue

Hi Brent,

Fixed the issue Grant reported with emails showing 0.00 cubic yards. It's live now.

THE PROBLEM:
- Email function wasn't working properly
- Cubic yards calculation was missing

THE FIX:
- Emails now send correctly when tickets are created
- Cubic yards always calculated and displayed (never shows 0.00)

NEXT STEPS:
Can you ask Grant to check the next few ticket emails he receives and confirm the cubic yards values look correct?

That should resolve his issue. Let me know if he sees any problems.

Best,
Chris
